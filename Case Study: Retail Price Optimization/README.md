*Case Study: Retail Price Optimization for a Clothing Store*

Company Background:
Imagine a clothing store called "Fashionista" that sells a wide range of apparel and accessories. Fashionista operates both physical stores and an online e-commerce platform. The company wants to optimize its pricing strategy to maximize revenue and improve competitiveness in the market.

Challenges Faced:
Fashionista is facing several challenges in pricing its products effectively:

Competitive Landscape: The retail industry is highly competitive, with multiple competitors offering similar products. Fashionista wants to gain a competitive edge by offering attractive prices without sacrificing profitability.

Inventory Management: Fashionista needs to manage its inventory effectively by setting prices that balance supply and demand. Optimizing prices based on inventory levels can help prevent overstocking or understocking of products.

Seasonal and Trend Variations: Fashion trends change rapidly, and demand for specific items fluctuates throughout the year. Fashionista needs to adapt its prices to reflect these seasonal and trend variations to capture maximum sales opportunities.
