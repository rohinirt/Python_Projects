Internship Program at Tesla

The Internship Recruiting Team is driven by the passion to recognize and develop emerging talent Our year-round program places the best students in positions where they will grow technically professionally and personally through their experience working closely with their Manager Mentor and team We are dedicated to providing an experience that allows the intern to experience life at Tesla by including them in projects that are critical to their team’s success

What You’ll Do
Craftsmanship is the perception of quality that a customer has about a product derived through sight touch sound and scent The Tesla Craftsmanship team is responsible for ensuring that all Tesla products have the highest level of perceived quality so they are utterly compelling in the store and provide a faultless experience during use

How do we do it? At the early stages we work with the Product Management teams to quantify the required product content the Design Studio to identify and resolve any issues relating to the concept the Engineering and Dimensional teams to develop achievable world-class gap and flush targets and the Manufacturing and Quality teams to identify and prioritize issues during pre-production and launch

Unique aspects of an internship in the Craftsmanship team include

Broad vehicle exposure – We get involved in the design and engineering of all customer-facing systems from seats to interior trim to exterior systems Embedded in the Engineering team this broad exposure makes for a huge variety in projects cross-functional interaction an ability to have a broad impact to the end product and accelerates understanding of the design detail of multiple systems across the vehicle

Target Setting Communication and Validation – We set measurable engineering targets that will deliver world-class craftsmanship through competitor vehicle benchmarking and data analysis validate those targets through physical models mockups and using digital visualization tools communicate and negotiate those targets with the wider Engineering and Studio teams ensuring that they are achievable and support the Engineering and Manufacturing teams in meeting those targets

Quantification of Customer Feeling – Much of what the Craftsmanship team does is turning subjective customer perception into objective engineering targets by quantifying the premium look sound or feel of a system and identifying all the sensory inputs that will deliver a “wow” experience For instance the premium feeling of an armrest that is not too soft or hard not too thick or thin is quantified with an engineering specification graph that defines force and deflection

What You’ll Bring

Attained or studying to attain a mechanical engineering industrial design or product design degree 
Strong communication and influencing skills 
An inherent attention to detail and an understanding of the factors that create a perception of exceptional quality in the mind of the consumer 
An understanding of the fundamentals of good design and user experience as well as the engineering fundamentals that facilitate delivery of the design 
An appreciation for the impact and contribution to dimensional variation in assemblies 
Some understanding of statistical analysis would be advantageous 
An appreciation of how subjective data can be measured or quantified to develop robust representative Craftsmanship targets 
Good level of numeracy literacy and logical reasoning skills
